# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Analysis
  Pyber gave me access to their raw city data and ride data. Using those files I explored the data to find out how the company is operating in their given markets. I found three main market types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. Using these three city types, I analyzed three topics.  
  
    Areas of Focus
      1. The rides per city type 
      2. The fare per city type 
      3. The fare per driver
  
  I then limited my findings to a four month snap shot betweeen the months January-April of 2019. Here's what I found:

## Results
  These charts display the total data for rides, drivers, and fares. It's clear that the Urban city type is the busiest for the company. 


| Total Rides   |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Rural         | 125           |
| Suburban      | 625           |
| Urban         | 1,625         |  


| Total Drivers |           |
|---------------|-----------|
| Rural         | 537       |
| Suburban      | 8,570     |
| Urban         | 59,602    |


| Total Fares |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Rural       | $4,327.93   |
| Suburban    | $19, 356.33 |
| Urban       | $39, 854.38 |

An interesting point to analyze is the driver-to-customer ratio. As the chart below shows, the Urban city type seems oversaturated with drivers. This is a benefit with regards to the customer/user because they have quicker access to cheaper rides. The drivers in the Urban area are competing with one-another just to get one customer. On the other hand, The Rural city type only has four drivers per customer. In this market we can see deduce that there may not be an over-arching need for the business. 

| Driver-to-Customer |          |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Rural              |  4.3     |
| Suburban           |  13.7    |
| Urban              |  39.6    |
