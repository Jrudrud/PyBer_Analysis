# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Analysis
  Pyber gave me access to their raw city data and ride data. Using those files I explored the data to find out how the company is operating in their given markets. I found three main market types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. Using these three city types, I analyzed three topics.  
  
    Areas of Focus
      1. The rides per city type 
      2. The fare per city type 
      3. The fare per driver
  
  I then limited my findings to a four month snap shot betweeen the months January-April of 2019. Here's what I found:

## Results
| Total Rides   |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Rural         | 125           |
| Suburban      | 625           |
| Urban         | 1625          |  
  
  There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type
