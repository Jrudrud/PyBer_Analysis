# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Analysis
  Pyber gave me access to their raw city data and ride data. Using those files I explored the data to find out how the company is operating in their given markets. I found three main market types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. Using these three city types, I analyzed three topics.  
  
    Areas of Focus
      1. The rides per city type 
      2. The fare per city type 
      3. The fare per driver
  
  I then limited my findings to a four month snap shot betweeen the months January-April of 2019. Here's what I found:

## Results
 
 These charts display the total data for rides, drivers, and fares. It's clear that the Urban city type is the busiest for the company. The data suggests that the Urban city type is the busiest for the company, and the Rural city type is where most of the opportunities for growth are. The Suburban city type seems to a balance in the second place between the Rural and Urban cities. There were 5x more rides in the Suburban cities than the Rural. Whereas there are 2.6x more total rides in the Urban cities than the Suburban.


| Total Rides   |               |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Rural         | 125           |
| Suburban      | 625           |
| Urban         | 1,625         |  


| Total Drivers |           |
|---------------|-----------|
| Rural         | 537       |
| Suburban      | 8,570     |
| Urban         | 59,602    |


| Total Fares |             |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Rural       | $4,327.93   |
| Suburban    | $19, 356.33 |
| Urban       | $39, 854.38 |

An interesting point to analyze is the driver-to-customer ratio. As the chart below shows, the Urban city type seems oversaturated with drivers. This is a benefit with regards to the customer/user because they have quicker access to cheaper rides. The drivers in the Urban area are competing with one-another just to get one customer. On the other hand, The Rural city type only has four drivers per customer. In this market we can see deduce that there may not be an over-arching need for the business. 

| Driver-to-Customer |          |
| ------------------ | -------- |
| Rural              |  4.3     |
| Suburban           |  13.7    |
| Urban              |  39.6    |


Analyzing the Pyber Fare Summary chart, we can see the overall business trends for the given months.

## Summary

Given the data I would like to make some suggestions:
      
       1. Lower the total drivers in the Urban city type
       2. Increase users in the Rural cities
       3. Capitalize on the weeks of peak activity and focus growth on the weeks of low activity
    
    
Due to how oversaturated the market is for the Urban cities, lowering the total drivers would not damage the customer experience. Simultaneously,            lowering the total drivers in the are will increase the business per driver which will enhance the driver experience for our                                employees.

Making these changes will continue to enhance the user experience for all of the customers while protecting the employee experience for driving for our company.
